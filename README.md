# RubeGoldberg
This demo is a simple virtual Rube Goldberg machine that I created in a couple weeks for my Math & Physics For Gaming course, and uses the Box2D physics engine to simulate the ball's physics.

How to run: Double-click on the RubeGoldberg/Release/RubeGoldberg.exe file
NOTE: In order to run the Rube Goldberg machine, you must have the Microsoft Direct3D 11.2 SDK installed on the machine. If that doesn't work, ensure that the machine has any version of Visual Studio installed.

How to start the Rube Goldberg machine: 
When the file is loaded, press the space bar to instantiate a ball in the upper left hand corner that will eventually make it to the bottom left corner of the screen. You can spawn more than one ball if you want. Also, the physics isn't quite perfect to counteract some of the randomness, so sometimes the ball gets stuck about midway through the machine.
